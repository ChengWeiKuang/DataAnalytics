# Data Analytic Projects Repository 

This repository contains some Data Analytics related projects that I have created during my free time. On top of showcasing my skills, this repository also serves as a record of what I have done before and how I wrote the code to perform some of the tasks.  
I find it fun to learn and explore new ways of getting and analyzing different kinds of data, and therefore, I may work on a new project and add the files into this repository from time to time.  

Here are the list of projects that I have at this moment:  
1. Machine Predictive Maintenance Classification
2. Production Data Processing and Dashboard

--- 

### 1. Machine Predictive Maintenance Classification
- **Summary**: This project aims to create a predictive model for predictive maintenance for a milling machine based on its historical data. Here, data exploration is first done to understand more about the dataset, as well as getting some preliminary insights on the factors that causes the machine failures to occur. Then, various machine learning and deep learning models are built, in an attempt to find out a model that can perform the prediction with the best performance. By the end of the project, one of the models is able to perform the prediction with an accuracy of 98.33% and an F1-score of 71.49%.  
- **Dataset**: Synthetic dataset obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/stephanmatzka/predictive-maintenance-dataset-ai4i-2020).  
- **Tools Used**: Python.  
- **Skills Used**: Data Visualization (Matplotlib, seaborn), Machine Learning (scikit-learn), Deep Learning (Tensorflow).

### 2. Production Data Processing and Dashboard
- **Summary**: This project is created as a simulated use case of how a manufacturing company can possibly create a dashboard to monitor the performance of their production line. As real-world data is usually confidential and difficult to obtain, some synthetic data is generated with Python instead. Then, assuming that the actual data is already available in an SQL database, an SQL script is used to process the raw data and updates the summary data in a few separate table in the same database. Finally, a dashboard is created with Power BI, for the engineers to analyze and monitor the performance of their products and test processes on the same platform.  
- **Dataset**: Self-generated synthetic dataset.  
- **Tools Used**: Python, SQL, Power BI.  
- **Skills Used**: Data Processing, Data Visualization (Power BI).
